# Calculator ++
***
## OVERVIEW
A fully complete basic calculator created in the C/C++ programming language that is both entertaining and simple to construct. It resembles an elementary/middle school calculator which allows us to Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Square and get the Square Root of a number.
***
## REASON FOR MAKING
This project was created for my Morgan State University peers who are just starting to learn how to code. Making a calculator, in my opinion, is the ideal first project in any language since you can learn a ton of concepts like:

* **Object-Oriented Programming**
* **Handling User Input and Output**
* **Implementing Functions**
* **Control Structures (loops/conditional statements)**
* **Validating User Input**
* **Comfortability with Git**

***

## How to use:

```
1. $ git clone https://github.com/Teqwon-Norman/simple-calculator.git
2. $ cd simple-calculator
3. $ make
4. $ ./main
```

### EXTRA INFORMATION
Calculator++ shows the clients its previous computed results each time the menu appears with the option to clear the memory just like that middle school calculator we all have used before. Have fun with this and if you are going to use this project to implement your own calculator, I challenge you to inherit a Scientific Mode and create the class and functions for it.
